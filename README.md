# SnakeRun ![snake](frontend/assets/snake.png)

## What inspired us
Inspired by 80s nostalgia, we decided to bring the game of snake into real life but with a small twist - to get people to leave the house, get out onto the streets, and get fit! We wanted to make a game that would motivate people to exercise and gave them healthy rewards to do so.

SnakeRun allows you to play a real life, multiplayer game of snake. The game drops random checkpoints around your location, and you can run/walk to the location to claim the points. Compete with friends on the leaderboard, and exchange points for vouchers to buy healthy food.
